<!-- Content Project Requirements -->
<h2>Project Requirements • Content :</h2>

1. • A <i>‘Home’</i> page that is visually appealing and features content sections that use images and text to introduce and link to the other pages of your website.

2. • A <i>‘Destinations’</i> page featuring an overview of each country your travel agency offers packages to.

3. • Each destination should feature at least 3 pages:

4. ∙ An <i>‘About’</i> (e.g. About Fiji) page featuring the location, demographics, exports, major cities and natural locations, cultural overview, and a brief history of the country.

5. ∙ A <i>‘Discover’</i> (e.g. Discover Fiji) page featuring the cultural traditions, associated locales, and other notable tourist destinations and activities.

6. ∙ A <i>‘Visit’</i> (e.g. Visit Fiji) page detailing the travel options to the country, lodging options (especially anything culturally or historically significant), and in-country transportation options.

7. • Each page should have a full-width ‘hero’ image near the top with the page title overlaid (using CSS not Photoshop).

8. • Each content item should feature multiple paragraphs of information and supporting images.

9. • Consistent color and font usage that enhances the legibility of your information.

10. • Content should be free of punctuation, grammar, and spelling errors.

11. • Copyrighted photos must be credited to the author/publisher.

12. • References to the sites used in your research should be located in the footer of the page(s) the source is used on.

<!-- Technical Project Requirements -->
<h2>Project Requirments • Technical :</h2>

1. • <i>A detailed Figma prototype</i> should be completed prior to writing any code.

2. • <i>Daily commits</i> to a shared Github repository by each team member during the programming phase.

3. • Consistently placed and styled navigation to all pages on each page
 
4∙ • The current page should not be removed from the navigation but marked as “active” and styled separately through css.
  
5. • Valid, semantic HTML/CSS (should pass the W3C HTML validator)

6. ∙ Semantic HTML uses more than “divs”. It incorporates, but is not limited to, the header, nav, main, section, article, aside, and footer elements to accurately describe the content of the element.

7. • <i>Multi</i>-column layout using CSS Flexbox
  
8. • <i>One</i> shared external CSS Stylesheet
  
9. • <i>CSS Media Queries</i> that enable your website to function well at any screen size. Minimally your site should adapt to:
  
10. ∙ <i>Desktop</i> >> ~992px wide

11. ∙ <i>Large Tablet</i> << ~992px wide

12. ∙ <i>Medium Tablet</i> << ~768px wide

13. ∙ <i>Phone</i> << ~480px wide

14. ∙ These widths are starting points and may vary based on your site layout. Fix your site at each width it “breaks” at.

15. • Footer including image credits, research citations along with crediting your team and CART.
  
16. • No text baked into image(s), you should always type textual information in your editor and overlay it on images with CSS.
